# Profiles for personall use

Configure `nnn`, `neovim`, `tmux`, etc.

In `.basrc` add `source ~/.nnn` at the end.

More info on vim -> neovim: [Migrating from vim to neovim – O. Valadares' Blog](https://otavio.dev/2018/09/30/migrating-from-vim-to-neovim/)

Details on `tmux` key bindings: [Vi mode in tmux | Arabesque](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vi-mode-in-tmux/)

Setting `vi` mode is useful, but can keep selection keys as space/enter.

Added better config for screen - shows status bar
